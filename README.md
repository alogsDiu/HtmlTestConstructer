# HtmlTestConstructer
This app constructs basic test as a web page with instant check given that questions are provided in a certain format.

You can see the format in a file named questions.txt in the resources folder. When using you should redefine the path for the Scanner and PrintWriter to the file you want to get questions from and write the html to.
